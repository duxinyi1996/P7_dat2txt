# P7_dat2txt: KLA P-7 `.dat` Decoder & Step Profile Extractor
This Python tool decodes `.dat` files generated by the KLA-Tencor P-7 stylus profilometer and extracts height profile data. It is designed to provide access to raw Z-data in a reproducible and automated way without access to APEX software.

## Features

- Automatic detection of measurement block within the binary `.dat` file  
- Decoding using fixed-point logic (int + frac)  
- Scaling based on recipe string (`Z_13UM`, `Z_131UM`, `Z_1048UM`)  
- Batch conversion of `.dat` files to `.txt` format  
- Output matches APEX ACSII format `.txt` export
- Auto-level and step height extraction  
- Jupyter Notebook–friendly structure for visualization and comparison  

## Example Notebook
See `P7_dat2txt.ipynb` for:

- Decoding and visualization
- Batch conversion for folders and files
- APEX .txt comparison
- Batch extraction of step height pipline
